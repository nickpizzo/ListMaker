# List Maker (React)

Today in class we introduced React and built a trivial "List Maker".

Your task tonight is to take the class exercise and add the ability to remove an item from the list.

## Deliverables

- [ ] Deploy to GH Pages (`gulp deploy`).

## Explorer Mode

- [ ] Fork this repo to your own account.
- [ ] Add the ability to remove and item by clicking on it.

It's okay if there are multiple items with the same value to remove them all.

_**Hint**:_ `Array.prototype.filter`

## Adventure Mode

It's no longer okay to remove multiple items if you've only clicked on one.

_**Hint**:_ Maybe an additional `prop`?

## Epic Mode

Have your list items persist between reloads.
